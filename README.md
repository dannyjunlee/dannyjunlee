# React Portfolio

## Description

This application is my personal portfolio. It was created via React, utilizing Bootstrap. As an aspiring web developer, I created this portfolio to not only display information about me and the work I have accomplished, but also do it through a technology I learned recently: ReactJS. This portfolio will serve as a supplement to my resume and hopefully help distinguish me from other developers in my job search.

## Installation

While this project is not intended to be installed or worked on by other developers, the way to install would be to first run `npm i`, then `npm start` for a local server version or `npm run deploy` for a deployed version.

## Usage

This project is a multi-page React application. While React does not support multiple pages as of the time of writing, I utilized react-dom-router and utilized routes to simulate the effect of multiple pages. Simply click the links in the navigation bar to navigate to each page. As of now, the contact page is not yet functional.

## Credits

As this project is my personal portfolio, it was worked on by myself. I used the documentation provided by Bootstrap, React, and React-Router-Dom where applicable.
